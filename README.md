# Getting and cleaning data course project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

### How to run the analysis
* The analysis can be reproduced by sourcing the `run_analysis.Rmd` file.
* The `run_analysis.Rmd` file will source all required files including `UCIDataReader.R`. 
* The `run_analysis.Rmd` file can also be re-knitted using knitr.

### Project files description
* `Readme.md` - this file.
* `codebook.md` : Descrition of the variables and the data. 
* `run_analysis.Rmd` : Main code file with all transformation and clean up operations documented.
* `UCIDataReader.R` : Helper function to download and read the UCI project data.
* `run_analysis.md` (generated by knitr) : Knitted file including the code, the documentation and results. 
* `run_analysis.html` (generated by knitr) : Knitted file including the code, the documentation and results.
* `tidyData.txt` : Tidy dataset resulting from run_analysis.Rmd
